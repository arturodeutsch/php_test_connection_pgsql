# php_test_connection_pgsql
the code you can see on this file will help you test the connection from the web server to the postgresql database.

Also can also check:
- if the php modulo pgsql is installed
- Postgresql version
- PHP version
- Apache Version
- Postgis Version

Remember you must edit your database parameters.

good luck with it!!!
